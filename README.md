IMPORTANT
=========

This project is in early stages of development. Expect stuff to not work.


![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nens/lizard-management-client/master/screenshot.jpg?token=AAAcGWEdm9ezSIyVUaNIkOxDiImLdpkOks5Z3cBuwA%3D%3D)

This is the React/Redux-based management interface for Lizard.

It enables administrators and power-users to perform administrative tasks, such as:

- User management
- Alarm management
- 3DI scenario management
- Billing etc.


Installation
============

- Required: A working nodejs and yarn installation.
- In the root directory of the repository: `$ yarn install`
- ...followed by `$ PROXY_USERNAME=<your_sso_username> PROXY_PASSWORD=<your_sso_password> yarn start`



create-react-app
================

The base skeleton for this project was generated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Have a look at CRA.md for its documentation.



Development
===========

A pre-commit hook is configured to run [Prettier.js](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) every time, so the codebase stays in consistent form, style-wise.

If you work on this project, please submit changes via Pull Requests and follow the [commit guidelines as outlined here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#commit-message-convention-at-a-glance).

See [![Standard Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-standard%20version-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

These commit messages will be used to auto-generate `CHANGELOG.md`.

Have a look at the [buck-trap README](https://github.com/nens/buck-trap/blob/master/README.md) for more information about the release procedure.

View development server on multiple devices
======================================

1. In lizard-nxt, go to the settings folder and make a file and name it 'localsettings.py'. In this file, write:
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', 'YOUR_HOSTNAME']

2. In this repository then, look for the 'start.js' file under 'scripts'. Change the line that contains:
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0', replace the HOST value with your IP address.

3. On another device you can now open de browser and go to 'http://YOUR_HOSTNAME:3000/




CSS
===

The first versions of this project used Twitter Bootstrap 4 for the styling of some components like Buttons, Forms and was especially chosen because of its popular grid system.

This worked well until the point where a lot of customization was needed. It required Ruby and Bundler to be installed, as well as some other dependencies. It also involved rebuilding the entire Bootstrap SCSS sourcetree every time.

Twitter Bootstrap was replaced by CSS Grid and Flexbox entirely in [PR #21](https://github.com/nens/lizard-management-client/pull/12).

This project now uses CSS modules almost entirely, save for some CSS reset code in `index.html`.



Production bundle
=================

Run `$ GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false yarn build` and look in the `build/` folder.


Releasing
=========

Run `$ yarn run release` and answer the questions accordingly.


Deployment
==========

For the deployment of frontend repositories we make use of the client
deployment repository https://github.com/nens/client-deployment. It is already
included as a git submodule in this repo.

Init the git submodule if you haven't done `clone --recursive`  or ran this command earlier:

```sh
git submodule init
```

To update the git submodule:

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --remote
```

Uses Ansible for deployment.

Ansible requires:

- the file `deploy/hosts` which can be created from `deploy.hosts.example` by filling out the server names. But it is best is to ask a collegue for this file.
- the file `deploy/production_hosts` which can be created from `deploy/production_hosts.example` by filling out the server names. But it is best is to ask a collegue for this file.
- the file `deploy/group_vars/all` which can be created from `deploy/group_vars/all.example` by filling each line with the correct value. But best is to ask a collegue for this file.

Ansible requires you to set a public ssh key on the remote server. Run the following command to send your public key to the server:

```sh
ssh-copy-id <USERNAME>@<SERVER_NAME>
```

Now deploy for staging:

```sh
npm run staging-deploy
```

Or deploy for production:

```sh
npm run production-deploy
```


_NOTE: When ansible complains about permissions this may be because the owners for some files were changed to `root`, where this should be `buildout`. In this case use ssh to connect to the server and navigate to the folder of the deployment path. Then change the owner of the `dist/` folder to buildout: ```chown -R buildout:buildout /dist```._





Internationalisation
====================

This client has l10n/i18n support via react-intl.

English is the default/fallback language.
Dutch is the only planned supported other language for now.

To extract translation tags to the i18n catalog: `$ yarn run i18n:extract`.
To update the language catalogs: `$ yarn run i18n:update`

To execute both subsequently, run: `$ yarn run i18n:extract-then-update`.

See `src/translations/locales/[language].json`. (where language is 'nl', for now)


Redux
=====

Redux is used for the app-wide notification system.


React-router
============

React-router is used for the URL setup.


Sentry
