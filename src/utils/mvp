*** Design ***

- Horizontal vs vertical layout of view tabs (JSON text >> JSON editor >> Visual editor) (Tom vs Lirry)
- JSON editor tab: icons for switch and pretty options
- Layout of a LizardRasterSource block
- Layout of a building block
- New Block view: as in a column or in its own modal with search bar and more documentation?
- Validation errors: how and where to show error messages?
- Option to edit/change an output block: with or without the +/- icons?
- Placement of default or constant values of a block (e.g. numbers): inside a building block or have its own input block?

*** MVP ***

- JSON text editor
- JSON structure viewer/editor
- Geoblock visual editor
- Client-side validation for the graph: UUID of raster, orphan parts
- Back-end validation
- Validation UI
- Fullscreen option?
- search bar for new blocks and more documentation on each block?

*** User stories ***

- User should be able to create a new graph using the geoblock build modal
- User should be able to edit an existing graph of a geoblock using the geoblock build modal
- User should be able to view a geoblock in JSON format or in a visual editor
- User should be able to edit/create a graph using either the JSON editor or the visual editor
- User should be able to see if the graph is valid or not and why it is not valid
