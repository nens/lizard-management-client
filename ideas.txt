- can we in the rastersource table show interval instead of temporal ?
- maybe we can check if sum checkbox below the table will work better ?
- what happens when all selected but user goes to next page? unselect all?
- how do I retrieve raster source size ?
- pagination in design. Although the new pagination cannot jump to page it may still know: to jump back to first page. What the current page is.
